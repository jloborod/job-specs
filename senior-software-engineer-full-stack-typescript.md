The best bit about Red Badger is, of course, the team. We are really proud of our people; we support and learn a lot from each other; we work really hard but have fun doing it. We are a diverse group made up of 22 different nationalities, speaking 17 different languages.
Our 3 founders, Dave, Cain and Stu, who have considerable tech and consultancy experience and still own 100% of the company. We’ve been consistently profitable and have grown responsibly from the beginning. 

We are based at Old Street in the heart of “tech city” and get thoroughly stuck in with the brilliant community around us. We run several meetups including the hugely popular React London, invite other groups to host their events in our office such as Lua London and Ladies Who Code and speak at events like Digital Shoreditch and LNUG.

### The Role

We’re looking for a Freelance Senior Software Engineer to join our digital product delivery function. Red Badger builds high-quality digital products using a lean delivery process and multidisciplinary, cross-functional teams. The work we do for our clients involves dealing with the core complexities of their business and the technology we employ varies from project to project. 

You will be a polyglot with extensive experience across a wide range of technologies and projects and will relish tackling and solving tough problems, digging deeper into areas you already know as well as expanding your skills into different languages, technologies and practices.

You’ll be comfortable designing and articulating solutions, working closely with clients to ensure we’re delivering the right thing in the right way. You will lead by example; getting your hands dirty in the code, inspiring your peers & educating our clients.

You are passionate about the craft of software development and contribute to technical and non-technical discussions that help shape the direction of digital product delivery. You are able to work independently, as well as collaboratively, on user stories within an agile delivery environment and are versed in modern software delivery practices. You care about creating quality software that meets the needs of our client’s vision and goals, in a thoughtfully pragmatic way.

As well as contributing to production-grade code bases, you will also be proactive in working directly with the client to help shape and move the project forward and, where required, helping to up-skill and embed good development practices within existing, newly formed or client/Badger blended cross-functional teams.
